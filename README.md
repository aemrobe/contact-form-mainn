## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- module css

### What I learned

In this challenge, I have learned how i can work with module css which is feature that some developers can use to write css classes for a specific component without worrying about that these classes might be used by the other developer who he/she is working with because the css class which that person writes inside that module will be unique evenif the other developer use the same classname inside other module. this is possible because of css module. it makes every className to be unique which is written inside that css module.

The other thing which i have learned from this challenges is how i can work with form validation with react. I have worked with form validation in js but this time in react it has some differences. It involves using states to control the inputs and use these value to implement the form validation and i felt a little bit easier when i work with react than js because i was able to use states to control the input values of the form.

### Continued development

In the future, i will continue to work with react and also include tailwindcss in my projects.
